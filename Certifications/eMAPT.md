## Tips and tricks

**Disclaimer**: I used INE [Mobile Application Penetration Testing](https://ine.com/learning/certifications/external/elearnsecurity-mobile-application-penetration-tester) course during my preparation. It includes all that you need to pass this exam but during my learning journey I also used other resources that are listed on this page.

- Do as many labs and challenges as possible from the course
- Make notes during the course
- Do an additional research if you want to better understand a specific topic
- Practice, practice, practice. Setup home lab using vulnerable mobile applications and try to find
as many vulnerabilities as possible
- Prepare a cheat sheet with commands and payloads that you've used in labs
- Automate attacks where possible. It'll come in handy not only during the exam but also in real life engagements
- Know your tools
- Review mitigation strategies for each vulnerability
- Pay attention to reporting and Letter of Engagement
- Do not rush, 7 days is more than enough to complete the pentest and write a report
- Make breaks when you're stuck
